# EK210
# Lamp post mounted flood detector code written in Visual Studio Code 2019 with PlatformIO.
# Libraries installed include: ArduinoJSON by Benoit Blanchon, RTCZero by Arduino, and WiFiEsp by bportaluri
# This code is meant to connect to the BU Guest wifi network. If you want to use this at home, the "SSID" and "Password" values must be updated.
# This code is meant to be used in combination with a REST client (Insomnia was used for this project) sending a post directly to the IP address reported by the Serial.
# This project drew major inspiration and guidance from this online tutorial, but involved a major amount of troubleshooting and coding in addition: https://kunzleigh.com/how-to-connect-an-arduino-to-the-internet-with-an-esp8266-module/
